          <p class="summary"> I like to cook dishes. From my childhood, I have seen my family arrange feasts very often. My mom used to spend long hours in the kitchen making the preparation & we siblings were used to it. But rarely did I participate in the cooking process even though I grew up by that time. After my marriage, my first journey into the kitchen started, especially when my kid was born. To feed my family I cook at least ¾ times a week. Sometimes more than that. So it has become a habit (in my subconscious mind). After some days I realized that cooking has become my passion. I like to cook different dishes and arrange feasts for my friends, relatives & neighbors. Then thought,  I should keep a memory (photos) of my dishes (which will be a good memory in my older age. hahaha)& also started writing recipes in the diary so I can not only re-use them but also will pass them to the next generation. That's how I started my journey towards my passion COOKING. I have created a photo album “Adiba’s Dine”  on my social media page where I post photos of my dishes. Soon I will start writing a blog that will contain tips & tricks on cooking & definitely recipes.  </p>

            I like to go for a walk with my kid. So each week pretty much every day I along with my kid go outside to enjoy walking & playing. Here, the most challenging is finding out a good park or play area. Of course, my kid isn't willing to go to the same place every day. So I keep my eye on social media to look for places that are enjoyable & new.
            Below is a link to a social page where people shares their & children's facility experiences with different park & places.

          <p class="summary">Montessori is a method of education that is based on self-directed activity, hands-on learning and collaborative play. In Montessori classrooms children make creative choices in their learning, while the classroom and the highly trained teacher offer age-appropriate activities to guide the process.  </p>
